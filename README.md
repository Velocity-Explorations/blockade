# btc-paywall

A proof-of-concept HTTP reverse proxy that gates access to protected resources behind a real Bitcoin payment. Every request to a protected endpoint must be accompanied by cryptographic proof that a real economic cost was paid — no free probing, no costless iteration.

Three payment backends are implemented in this repository, each as a self-contained POC:

| POC | Backend | Token scheme | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lightning L402 (httpbin upstream) | `L402 <macaroon>:<preimage>` | 8080 |
| 2 | Lightning L402 (Keycloak OIDC upstream) | `L402 <macaroon>:<preimage>` | 8090 |
| 3 | On-chain Bitcoin | `BTC-Onchain <address>` | 8092 |

All three run from the same compiled binary; the active backend is selected by config.

## Why

AI-driven adversaries can now iterate against logical access controls (permissions, identity checks, rule-based filters) at near-zero marginal cost. The asymmetry is structural: defense costs continue to rise while attack costs approach zero.

The only constraint that cannot be bypassed through intelligence is physical cost. This proxy shifts the access control question from *"who are you?"* to *"what did it cost you to be here?"* — imposing a real, configurable economic cost on every interaction, making large-scale automated probing prohibitively expensive.

### Key design decision: `PaymentVerifier`

```go
type PaymentVerifier interface {
    IssueChallenge(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) error
    VerifyProof(token string) (bool, error)
    ExtractToken(authHeader string) (string, bool)
}
```

The proxy (`internal/proxy/proxy.go`) calls only this interface — it has no imports from any backend package. `IssueChallenge` writes the 402 response with whatever challenge the backend requires. `VerifyProof` validates the credential. `ExtractToken` parses the backend-specific `Authorization` scheme so the proxy stays scheme-agnostic.

The active backend is selected at startup based on which config section (`lnd` or `bitcoind`) is present in the config file.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (v2)
- `jq` (used by the setup and e2e scripts)
- Go 1.22+ (only needed for local development outside Docker)

## Infrastructure Requirements

The base stack runs five containers simultaneously.

**Per-service RAM profile:**

| Service | RAM | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `bitcoind` | ~300 MB | regtest — no chain to sync, starts immediately |
| `lnd-server` | ~300 MB | briefly CPU-intensive at wallet init |
| `lnd-client` | ~300 MB | same |
| `httpbin` | ~150 MB | Python + Gunicorn |
| `proxy` | ~75 MB | lightweight Go binary |
| Docker daemon + OS | ~400 MB | baseline |
| **Total** | **~1.5 GB** | |

**Disk:**

`docker-compose.yml` uses `build: .`, so `make up` runs a full Go build inside Docker on first run. The builder downloads all of lnd's transitive dependencies before compiling.

| Item | Size |
|---|---|
| Docker images (all services) | ~1 GB |
| Docker build cache (Go deps + compilation) | ~3–4 GB |
| lnd / bitcoind volume data (regtest) | < 100 MB |
| OS + Docker install | ~3 GB |
| **Total** | **~8 GB used** |

**Recommended VM sizing:**

| Resource | Minimum | Comfortable |
|---|---|---|
| vCPU | 2 | 2 |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB |
| Disk | 20 GB | 40 GB |

Two vCPUs matter during `make setup`: lnd wallet initialization on both nodes runs concurrently and briefly saturates a single core.

## POC 1: Lightning L402 Paywall

The base POC. The proxy enforces the [L402 protocol](https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402): every request must carry a Lightning payment preimage as proof of expenditure.

```

  |                               |  SHA256(preimage)==hash?  |                   |

  |                               |-------------------------------- GET /protected>|
  |<-- 200 OK --------------------|<----------------------------------------------|
```

Tokens are single-use. Replaying a used token returns `401 Unauthorized`.

### Quick start

```bash
make up        # build image, start bitcoind + lnd-server + lnd-client + httpbin + proxy
make setup     # one-time: mine blocks, fund nodes, open Lightning channel
make e2e-test  # 402 → pay invoice → retry with token → assert 200
```

### Manual walkthrough

> For a deeper, code-referenced explanation of what each step proves, see [`docs/e2e-walkthrough.md`](docs/e2e-walkthrough.md).

**Step 1 — Hit a protected endpoint without a token:**

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/get
```

Expected response:
```
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
WWW-Authenticate: L402 macaroon="<base64>", invoice="lnbc..."
```

**Step 2 — Pay the invoice from the client node:**

```bash
docker compose exec lnd-client lncli --network=regtest payinvoice --force <bolt11-invoice>
```

The command prints a `payment_preimage` hex string on success.

**Step 3 — Retry with the L402 token:**

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/get \
  -H "Authorization: L402 <macaroon>:<preimage>"
```

Expected response: `200 OK` with the httpbin JSON body.

**Step 4 — Confirm anti-replay:**

Repeat the same curl from Step 3. Expected response: `401 Unauthorized` — the token is single-use.

### Tear down

```bash
make down    # stop containers, preserve data volumes
make clean   # stop containers AND delete volumes (full reset)
```

## POC 2: Keycloak Login Paywall

Puts the same L402 paywall in front of Keycloak's OIDC token endpoint. The compelling defense case: **every credential submission costs sats, including failed ones**. Credential stuffing is no longer free even against an attacker who guesses wrong every time.

This POC reuses the existing proxy binary (one binary, two configs) and runs under a Docker Compose `keycloak` profile, leaving the base stack untouched. `make up && make setup` must be run first.

See [`examples/keycloak-login/README.md`](examples/keycloak-login/README.md) for the full walkthrough and [`docs/keycloak-poc-plan.md`](docs/keycloak-poc-plan.md) for the design rationale.

### Quick start

```bash
make up && make setup    # base stack (if not already running)
make up-keycloak         # adds Keycloak + a second proxy instance on :8090
make e2e-keycloak-test   # three-phase test: pay → valid creds → 200+JWT;
                         #   pay → wrong creds → 401 from Keycloak;
                         #   replay same token → 401 from proxy
```

### Tear down

```bash
make down-keycloak    # stop Keycloak profile services only
make clean-keycloak   # stop + delete Keycloak volumes
```

## POC 3: On-Chain BTC Paywall

Replaces the Lightning backend with direct on-chain Bitcoin payments. The proxy talks to bitcoind via JSON-RPC — no lnd, no channels, no liquidity management. Each request requires a payment to a freshly generated address; access is granted as soon as the transaction appears in the mempool (0-conf).

This POC is deliberately designed to highlight the *contrast* with Lightning: on-chain fees impose a practical price floor (the Bitcoin dust limit is ~294 sats for P2WPKH outputs), making per-request micropayments economically impractical at small amounts. The same `PaymentVerifier` interface accommodates it with no changes to the proxy core — only a new package and a config file.

**This POC runs standalone — it does not require lnd-server, lnd-client, or `make setup`.** The only container it needs is bitcoind. Test payments are sent via `bitcoin-cli` from a funded regtest wallet that `make setup-onchain` creates.

See [`examples/onchain-btc/README.md`](examples/onchain-btc/README.md) for the full walkthrough and [`docs/onchain-btc-poc-plan.md`](docs/onchain-btc-poc-plan.md) for the design rationale.

### Quick start

```bash
make up-onchain          # starts bitcoind + httpbin + onchain-paywall (:8092) only
make setup-onchain       # creates wallets, mines 101 blocks for test funds (run once)
make e2e-onchain-test    # three-phase test: pay address → 200;
                         #   replay spent address → 401;
                         #   unpaid address → 401
```

### Tear down

```bash
make down-onchain    # stop on-chain profile services only
make clean-onchain   # stop + delete on-chain volumes
```

---

## Configuration

`config.yaml` controls the proxy. The Docker Compose setup mounts it read-only inside the container. Exactly one backend section (`lnd` or `bitcoind`) must be present.

**Lightning backend** (POC 1 and POC 2):
```yaml
listen_addr: ":8080"

lnd:
  host: "lnd-server:10009"          # lnd gRPC endpoint
  tls_cert_path: "/lnd/tls.cert"    # from the shared lnd-server-data volume
  macaroon_path: "/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/regtest/admin.macaroon"

routes:
  - path_prefix: "/get"
    upstream: "http://upstream:80"
    price_sats: 10
  - path_prefix: "/post"
    upstream: "http://upstream:80"
    price_sats: 50
```

**On-chain Bitcoin backend** (POC 3):
```yaml
listen_addr: ":8092"

bitcoind:
  host: "bitcoind:18443"            # bitcoind JSON-RPC endpoint
  rpc_user: "bitcoin"
  rpc_password: "bitcoin"

routes:
  - path_prefix: "/get"
    upstream: "http://upstream:80"
    price_sats: 1000                 # higher floor due to on-chain dust limits
  - path_prefix: "/post"
    upstream: "http://upstream:80"
    price_sats: 5000
```

Each route maps a path prefix to an upstream and a per-request price in satoshis. Unmatched paths return `404 Not Found`.

## Local Development (without Docker)

```bash
make build                     # produces bin/proxy
./bin/proxy -config config.yaml
```

For the Lightning backend, the proxy needs a reachable lnd node. Point it at the Docker Compose `lnd-server` (exposed on `localhost:10009`):

```yaml
lnd:
  host: "localhost:10009"
  tls_cert_path: "/path/to/lnd-server-data/tls.cert"
  macaroon_path: "/path/to/lnd-server-data/data/chain/bitcoin/regtest/admin.macaroon"
```

For the on-chain backend, the proxy needs a reachable bitcoind node with a loaded wallet. Point it at the Docker Compose `bitcoind` (exposed on `localhost:18443`):

```yaml
bitcoind:
  host: "localhost:18443"
  rpc_user: "bitcoin"
  rpc_password: "bitcoin"
```

Run `docker volume inspect btc-paywall_lnd-server-data` to find where Docker stores the lnd volume on your host.
